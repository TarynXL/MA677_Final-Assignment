# MA677_Final-Assignment

This report is for MA677 final project. In this report, I will reproduce 4 examples in Chapter 6 in Computer Age Statistical Inference. Chapter 6 contains four examples – insurance claims (Robbins’ Formula), species discovery(The Missing-Species Problem), Shakespeare’s vocabulary, and lymph node counts (A Medical Example). In each example, the result of the empirical Bayes analysis is given.
